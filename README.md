- Link to webpage [DEMO LINK](https://vadym-liubych.github.io/user-list/).

Description:
  - Using HTML + CSS + JavaScript stack Implement a table - a list of users.
  
It is necessary to implement the following functionality:
  - URL for loading data (users): https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users;
  - Displaying of: name, username, email, website for each user in the table;
  - Opening a modal window with more detailed information by clicking on a specific user, for example street,
    city, zip code, etc;
  - Sorting users by any field, for example, by clicking on a column header;
  - Ability to add users.

Requirements:
  - Do not use third-party libraries/frameworks when implementing this. The logic must be written in pure
    JavaScript.
    
Additionally it would be nice to implement:
  - Cross-browser compatibility (explicitly state which browsers are supported and to what level);
  - Support for mobile browsers (iOS and or Android) with specialized mobile layout;
  - Ability to remove users.
